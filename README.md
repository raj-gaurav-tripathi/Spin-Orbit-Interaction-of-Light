# Spin–Orbit Interaction in Anisotropic Waveguided Plasmonic Crystals

This repository contains the academic report **“Spin–Orbit Interaction in Anisotropic Waveguided Plasmonic Crystals”**, prepared as part of coursework/research work at the **Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Kolkata**, under the **Bio-Optics and Nano-Photonics Laboratory**.

The report presents a theoretical and computational study of polarization optics and spin–orbit interaction (SOI) of light, with a particular focus on anisotropic plasmonic crystal systems and momentum-space polarimetry.

##  Document Overview

The report develops a unified framework combining classical polarization optics with modern spin–orbit photonics. The work progresses from foundational formalisms (Jones, Stokes, Mueller) to advanced concepts such as geometric phase, spin Hall effects of light, and spin-to-orbital angular momentum conversion in structured optical media.

Key themes include:

* Polarization state representation and measurement
* Light–matter interaction in anisotropic media
* Angular momentum of light (SAM & OAM)
* Spin–orbit interaction and geometric phases
* Momentum-resolved Mueller matrix analysis
* Modeling and simulation of plasmonic crystals
